  <h1>Cheating AIccusations</h1>  
  <!--Body-->  
  <p>  
   Your girlfriend slapped you because you "cheated on her". But you have no memory of you doing so. You ask for evidence and Neuro (the robot girl) shows up and drops a folder on the floor. The folder contains evidence of you hanging out with other girls while going to a hotel. The pictures are slightly weird to see and you're confused because you have never met those women before. What should you do to settle this?  
  </p>  
  <br>  
  <!--Answers-->  
  <p id="answers">A. "I don't remember doing this!" <br> B. "I'm breaking up with you." <br> C. "Let me examine those pictures." </p>

You bring out your briefcase and start packing up your things. As you were about to leave, a gunshot is heard. You feel pain behind your back and collapsed. You died.`;

      fate(1);  
      document.getElementById("answers").innerHTML=`<b>C. "Let me examine those pictures."</b><br><br>"Wait...", she said and you go to your computer. Luckily, you have an AI Image Detector program installed and analysed the pictures. They were all fake. Your girlfriend panicked and left and for some reason, Neuro shutted down on her own. `;
